Analysis of UK Accident Data using Hadoop and Pig environment


## 3. Use Clear Section Headings

Make sure to use clear section headings to guide the reader through your document. This helps to indicate where the code ends and where explanations or additional information begin.

### Example with Section Headings



Here is a snippet of a PIG script:

```pig
-- Load accident data
accident_data = LOAD '/user/big_data_project/UK_CarAccident_Data.csv' USING PigStorage(',');
```

*Line number 2: This line does not need to be a part of the code*
